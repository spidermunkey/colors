I've through a node/express/mongo tutorial so that I may impliment the api in a much cleaner way
--that may also--
be used in the wild with different users or at the least across remote/separate environments

I think that the code I've used is good enough for me to start using for my icon and color library
and has also given me a good starting point to build powerful features on top of what I've already done
using Node

It feels as though learning Node/Express/Mongo is the missing link that I've been looking for to really 
take my skills as a developer to the next level, event though I still get the sense that there is so much 
more to learn.

From this point of view I think its best if I spent the next week really solidifying and building on what I've 
learned in the NodeJS tutorial by building other applications utilizing the same paradigms

To do so I plan to cross reference the material with narrower/focused courses from other intructors, focusing on 
specific use cases/advantages of Node/Express over other backend languages, while focusing on design patterns, and 
paradigms that pertain to computer science in a broader sense. 

To do so I should build a set of small apps that focus on:
    
    utilizing data from an api,
    persisting it across time,
    building/organizing views based on input and data bindings
    
        TASK MANAGER
        BIRTHDAY BOOK
        BUDGET PLANNER
        WISHLIST/SHOPPING LIST += PRICECHECKER
        NEWSFEED/CURRENT EVENTS += NOTIFCATIONS
        BUSINESS FEED/STOCK TICKERS += EXCHANGE RATE

    giving myself a stern goal of 48 hours to complete each one so that I don't
    focus to much on design, instead focus on iterating over techniques I've
    learned thus far in my journey.
